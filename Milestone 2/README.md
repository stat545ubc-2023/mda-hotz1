# mda-hotz1/Milestone 2

## What is this folder?

This is a folder for the second part of the Mini Data Analysis (MDA) project which is a part of the STAT 545A course at the University of British Columbia. The MDA project is an individual project for the course where each student carries out a self-directed statistical analysis in R (using the material taught in the course) on one of seven provided datasets from the `datateachr` library in R. The second milestone of the MDA project is a continuation of Milestone 1, and the files in this repository pertaining to that section of the project are located at [this link](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/Milestone%201).

## What are the files in this folder?

There are a handful of files in this sub-folder of the repository which you may be interested in viewing.
- [`Deliverable-2.Rmd`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/blob/main/Milestone%202/Deliverable-2.Rmd): This is an RMarkdown file which contains the R code for the data analyses, transformations, model fitting, and plotting which were carried out as sub-tasks of the Milestone 2 project.
- [`Deliverable-2.md`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/blob/main/Milestone%202/Deliverable-2.md): This is a GitHub-compatible markdown file which is created by knitting the `Deliverable-2.Rmd` file to 'GitHub-flavoured' markdown. The contents of this file match the content of `Deliverable-2.Rmd`, but unlike the RMarkdown version of this file, the contents of this file can be read directly on the GitHub website without requiring you to download any programs or files.
- [`README.md`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/blob/main/Milestone%202/README.md): The file which you are reading at the moment. It is a standard README file, which is useful for orienting yourself with the project and the repository.
- [`Deliverable-2_files/figure-gfm/`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/Milestone%202/Deliverable-2_files/figure-gfm/): A folder within the Git repository which contains six PNG files. Each of these PNG files is a plot which is displayed in `Deliverable-2.md`, and these images exist as part of the repository because GitHub uses this folder to store the images so they can be properly rendered and displayed in `Deliverable-2.md`.

## How do I use this folder?

Great question! If you would just like to read the analyses, then you can open `Deliverable-2.md` in GitHub (no download needed), which details the entirety of the MDA project and the statistical analysis done as a part of this project. 

If you would like to use R and RMarkdown to continue the work done in this repository, then you can download `Deliverable-2.Rmd` (and the other files in the repository, if you would like to), and run the code chunk-by-chunk in that file. The R libraries/packages required for this project are `datateachr`, `tidyverse`, `stringr`, `broom`, and `here`. 

Instructions for downloading the `datateachr` library are given at the top of [`Deliverable-1.Rmd`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/blob/main/Milestone%201/Deliverable-1.Rmd), and the remaining R packages can be installed directly using the `install.packages` function in R.
