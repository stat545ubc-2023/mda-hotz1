## What is this repository?

This is a repository for the Mini Data Analysis (MDA) project which is a part of the STAT 545A course at the University of British Columbia. The MDA project is an individual project for the course where each student carries out a self-directed statistical analysis in R (using the material taught in the course) on one of the seven provided datasets.

## What are the files in this repository?

There are a handful of files in this repository which you may be interested in viewing.
- `Deliverable-1.Rmd`: This is an RMarkdown file which contains the R code for the data analyses and transformations which were carried out as part of this project.
- `Deliverable-1.md`: This is a GitHub-compatible markdown file which is created by knitting the `Deliverable-1.Rmd` file to markdown. The content of this file matches the content of `Deliverable-1.Rmd`, but it is in a more readable format, and can be read directly on the GitHub website without downloading any files.
- `README.md`: The file which you are reading at the moment. It is a standard README file, which is useful for orienting yourself with the project and the repository.
- `Deliverable-1_files/figure-gfm/`: A folder within the Git repository which contains three PNG files. These PNGs are the three plots shown in `Deliverable-1.md`, and GitHub accesses those images via this folder. 

## How do I use this repository?

Great question! If you would just like to read the analyses, then you can open `Deliverable-1.md` in GitHub (no download needed), which details the entirety of the MDA project and the statistical analysis done as a part of this project. 

If you would like to use R to continue the work done in this repository, then you can download `Deliverable-1.Rmd` (and the other files in the repository, if you would like to), and run the code chunk-by-chunk in that file. The only R libraries/packages required for this project are `datateachr`, `tidyverse`, and `stringr`. Instructions for downloading the `datateachr` library are given at the top of `Deliverable-1.Rmd`, and the other two packages can be installed directly using the `install.packages` function in R.
