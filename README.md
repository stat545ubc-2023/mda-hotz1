# mda-hotz1

## What is this repository?

This repository contains all of my work on both sections of the Mini Data Analysis (MDA) project, which is the final project for STAT 545A at the University of British Columbia. 

The MDA project is an individual project for the course where each student carries out a self-directed statistical analysis in R (using the material taught in the course) on one of seven provided datasets from the `datateachr` library in R. The project is split into two sections, [Milestone 1](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/Milestone%201), and [Milestone 2](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/Milestone%202). There is an additional sub-folder in this repository called [output](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/output), which contains two files that are generated in the second part of the MDA project.

## What are the files and folders in this repository?

The main folder in the repository only has one file, which is called `README.md`, which is also the file that you are reading right now. There are three "first level" sub-folders in this repository, which are [Milestone 1](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/Milestone%201), [Milestone 2](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/Milestone%202), and [output](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/output). Each of these three folders has its own `README.md` file which provides additional information about the files in that folder. At a glance, these folders represent the following stages of the project:
- [`Milestone 1`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/Milestone%201): The first part of the MDA project. This GitHub repository initially contained the files which are in this folder, which is reflected in the release `m1.0`.
- [`Milestone 2`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/Milestone%202): Files relating to the second part of the MDA project.
- [`output`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/output): Two files (one csv and one R binary file) which are generated in the second part of the MDA project.

## How do I use this repository?

Great question! If you would just like to read the analyses, then you can open [`Deliverable-1.md`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/blob/main/Milestone%201/Deliverable-1.md) and [`Deliverable-2.md`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/blob/main/Milestone%202/Deliverable-2.md), which can be viewed without downloading any files from this repository. These two markdown files encompass the entire MDA project, and all the statistical analyses done as part of this project.

If you would like to use R and RMarkdown to continue the work done in this repository, then you can download [`Deliverable-1.Rmd`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/blob/main/Milestone%201/Deliverable-1.Rmd) and [`Deliverable-2.Rmd`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/blob/main/Milestone%202/Deliverable-2.Rmd), and the other files in the repository if you wish, and run the code chunk-by-chunk in those two RMarkdown files.

The R libraries and packages required to locally run these two files are `datateachr`, `tidyverse`, `stringr`, `broom`, and `here`. Instructions for downloading the `datateachr` library are given at the top of [`Deliverable-1.Rmd`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/blob/main/Milestone%201/Deliverable-1.Rmd), and the remaining R packages can be installed directly using the `install.packages` function in R.
