# mda-hotz1/output

## What is this folder?

This is a folder for the second part of the Mini Data Analysis (MDA) project which is a part of the STAT 545A course at the University of British Columbia. The MDA project is an individual project for the course where each student carries out a self-directed statistical analysis in R (using the material taught in the course) on one of seven provided datasets from the `datateachr` library in R. 

## What are the files in this folder?

There are only two other files (not including the README which you are reading right now) in this folder, both of which are generated as a part of the Milestone 2 project. For more information on Milestone 2 of the MDA project, please navigate yourself towards the [Milestone 2 folder](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/blob/main/Milestone%202).

The two files in this folder are the following:
- [`apt_units_lm.rds`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/blob/main/output/apt_units_lm.rds): An R binary file which stores a linear model. The linear model is created in Task 3 of Milestone 2. For more information and context on this task, please check out [`Deliverable-2.md`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/Milestone%202/Deliverable-2.md).
- [`building_age_summary.csv`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/output/building_age_summary.csv): A csv (comma-separated values) file containing information on a ward-by-ward basis about apartment buildings in the City of Toronto. This data is generated in Task 1 of Milestone 2, and saved locally to disk in Task 4 of the project. For more information and context on this task, please check out [`Deliverable-2.md`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/Milestone%202/Deliverable-2.md).
- [`README.md`](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/blob/main/output/README.md): The file which you are reading at the moment. It is a standard README file, which is useful for orienting yourself with the project and the repository.

## How do I use this folder?

This folder in and of itself is likely not particularly useful for you. You are free to look at the other two files which are located in this folder, although it would likely be a more efficient use of your time if you were to look at the [Milestone 1](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/Milestone%201) and [Milestone 2](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/mda-hotz1/tree/main/Milestone%202) folders instead, as they contain the real "meat" of the Mini Data Analysis project.
